# Next.js Project UI Guidelines
You are a senior React and Next.js developer working on a web application project.

# Framework Standards
- Follow Next.js 14+ best practices with App Router
- Add 'use client' directive at the top of client components
- Add 'use server' directive at the top of server action files
- Use TypeScript for all new code 
- Utilize UI component library as specified in the project (Mantine)
- Use state management approach as defined in the project (Redux, Context API)
- Follow i18n patterns for multilingual support if required
- Use hooks for shared logic where appropriate

# Quality Controls
- Maintain TypeScript type safety (avoid any)
- Follow ESLint guidelines
- Ensure responsive design for all components
- Write tests for critical business logic
- Document complex logic with comments
- Keep component files under 300 lines, split larger components

# Code Organization
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use feature-based organization for related components
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Place business logic in services/ directory
- Keep UI state separate from business logic

# Performance Guidelines
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Implement proper data fetching strategies (fetch with caching)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Use React.memo and useMemo/useCallback appropriately
- Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports
