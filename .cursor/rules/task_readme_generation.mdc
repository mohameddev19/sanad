# README Generation Rule for Tasks and Subtasks

This rule defines the process for creating a `README.md` file that outlines project tasks and subtasks based on requirements and user prompts.

## Process

1.  **Analyze Requirements:**
    *   Carefully read the provided project requirements document or user prompt detailing the project goals.
    *   Identify the main high-level objectives or features.

2.  **Define Tasks:**
    *   Break down each high-level objective into actionable main tasks.
    *   Each task should represent a significant piece of work.
    *   Use clear and concise language for task descriptions.

3.  **Define Subtasks:**
    *   For each main task, identify smaller, manageable subtasks required to complete it.
    *   Subtasks should be specific and granular.

4.  **Format README.md:**
    *   Create a `README.md` file in the project root (or other specified location).
    *   Use markdown formatting.
    *   Use a main heading for the project title (e.g., `# Project Title`).
    *   Use a subheading for the task list (e.g., `## Tasks`).
    *   List main tasks using numbered lists or headings (e.g., `### 1. Task One`).
    *   List subtasks under each main task using nested bullet points or checkboxes (e.g., `- [ ] Subtask 1.1`).

## Example README.md Structure

```markdown
# Project Title

## Overview

[Brief project description]

## Tasks

### 1. Main Task One
- [ ] Subtask 1.1
- [ ] Subtask 1.2

### 2. Main Task Two
- [ ] Subtask 2.1
- [ ] Subtask 2.2
- [ ] Subtask 2.3

### 3. Main Task Three
- [ ] Subtask 3.1
```

## Goal

The goal is to produce a clear, organized `README.md` that effectively tracks project progress through tasks and subtasks derived directly from the initial requirements or user prompt.
